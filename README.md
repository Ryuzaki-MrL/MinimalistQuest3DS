## Minimalist Quest

Minimalist Quest is a zelda-like RPG with minimalistic, yet charming graphics.
The intended goal is to save your friends and then escape the dungeon.
However, you may leave as soon as you get a key, if you wish so.

This game was originally made for the Minimalistic Jam 2 on itch.io
and is now being ported to the Nintendo 3DS under my personal (and now public)
game engine.

The tools for messing with the data files are available [here](https://github.com/Ryuzaki-MrL/MinimalistTools).
